📚 About the Project

We recreated a portfolio website using HTML and CSS (with optional Bootstrap for easier styling).
The focus was on building a clean, responsive design while practicing teamwork and good coding practices.

🛠️ How We Built It


We divided the website into parts (Header,Home, About, Services,Featured Skills, Skills, Gallery, Footer).

Each member worked on specific sections.

We used semantic HTML for structure.

CSS and JavaScript were used for styling and mobile responsiveness.

We made sure the code was clean, organized, and commented for easy understanding.
